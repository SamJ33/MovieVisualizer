titanic,Fascinating to see the story of the Titanic through the lens of the Nazi propaganda machine Instead of the typical display of overconfidence exhibited by the British when it comes to the ship s unsinkability its downfall comes from the Englishmen s capitalist motivations If NOT for the upright and perfect in every way German first officer you might be able to get away with saying there s NOT a ton of pro Fascist propaganda in here at all just anti capitalist ideas And more,-0.1779,Negative,6/18/2024,1
titanic,Good educational movie on the English s damning and eternal quest for profit and the Germans intelligence and heroism Idk why people would say this is propaganda,0.836,Positive,2/16/2023,1
titanic,TITANIC 1943 Ever since the sinking of The Sinking of Titanic on April 14th 1912 the tragedy has captures the minds of people for over a century This of course goes WITHOUT saying for Cinema however the first films about the sinking came out with a space of a few months of the sinking The first being the lost 1912 film SAVED FROM THE TITANIC which premiered 29 days after the sinking The second film to deal with the more,-0.4883,Negative,4/11/2022,1

titanic,yes it makes some salient points about how capitalistic hubris led to the Titanic disaster and yes the sinking sequences are a technological marvel of its era to the extent that some were later recycled in A Night to Remember,0.6369,Positive,12/6/2018,1

titanic,A historical travesty but also surprisingly technically capable and a fascinating piece of propaganda,0.7964,Positive,12/9/2022,1
titanic,Honestly kinda fascinating? Like fuck the Nazis and this movie isn t good by any means but there s a lot to read into While this movie s meant to be hyper critical propoganda of the British and Capitalism it kinda inadvertsntly reflects the situation of the Nazis themselves in the middle of the war being led into disaster by megalomaniacal bigoted leaders who were completely blind to the suffering of the people Plus the weird parallels this shares with Cameron s Titanic it s interesting I wouldn t recommend watching the whole movie yourself but it s definitely interesting to read about,-0.709,Negative,9/2/2023,1
titanic,Anti british propaganda movie Main story centers around the characters and through the flowers HATE against capitalism is obvious here dam greedy stupid capitalists! Still it is impressive movie and knowing that WWII was ongoing when the filmmakers made this movie it cost ca 200 million US dollars,-0.8866,Negative,12/30/2022,1
titanic,The nazis were really like yeah let s make a movie about how Germans would have for sure NOT have sunk the Titanic,0.763,Positive,7/25/2021,1
titanic,This 1943 German Titanic movie is a flawed and problematic film that fails to do justice to the tragedy of the Titanic s sinking Its propaganda and anti British sentiments undermine its cinematic qualities and historical accuracy and its association with the Nazi regime further complicates its legacy,-0.9042,Negative,1/9/2021,1
titanic,Inherently quite silly in concept with the haunting caveat of Herbert Selpin and Joseph Goebbels The latter commissioned the film s creation the former was personally chosen by Goebbels as the film s original director,0.4005,Positive,12/6/2022,1
titanic,The brass band didn t set the same tone as the string band did in Cameron s version,0,Neutral,10/12/2022,1
titanic,I was curious about the Nazi Titanic as this film is known I expected it to be TERRIBLE as I had read several lackluster reviews beforehand but I was pleasantly surprised Of course it s NOT great but it was engaging enough to keep my interest even if part of that interest was studying the faces of all of the actors intently and wondering if they were actual Nazis or those apolitical folks who looked the other way in complicit silence more,0.908,Positive,4/5/2022,1
titanic,The downfall of the Titanic filled with a thick portion of Nazi propaganda and some now refuted stories about the catastrophe The figure drawing here is really annoying So all foreigners are either cowards or greedy pig dogs and only the Germans who are pushing into history are heroic deeds or are ironed their husbands The only officer who takes the warnings about ice seriously and tries in vain to dissuade captain Smith from his irresponsible record trip to New York is of course a German On the other hand Smith is through certain more,-0.8858,Negative,12/9/2024,1
titanic,German made version of the sinking is very unsympathetic to the British built around the myth that the Titanic was trying to set a record for speed Makes me suspect there was tension between the two countries at the time,-0.5423,Negative,7/30/2023,1
titanic,As someone who really hasn t been submerged in the cinematic Titanic ethos my one viewing of the seminal James Cameron Titanic was a long ago television edit that s barely lingered in memory it was striking how alien this early Nazified version is from popular conception of what a Titanic story is These differences don t serve the story well the scenes dedicated to wealthy industrialists fretting over stocks and the invented heroic German officer all play as clumsy and ineffective The more,0.9313,Positive,11/9/2024,1
titanic,Surprisingly in Nazi titanic the only smart and good person is German,0.7783,Positive,6/4/2019,1
titanic,This 1943 German film is an account of the Titanic s tragic voyage but with a pro Nazi lens Objectively NOT a particularly good or bad movie the British and their capitalistic greed refuse to listen to a respectable German as the ship heads toward its icy doom Unless you re interested in propaganda the 1953 one is better,-0.8941,Negative,7/29/2024,1
titanic,This was a strange one I have seen every major film about the sinking of the Titanic I didn t like that they had shoehorned some random fictional characters with the historical characters I appreciate it was a propaganda film but all the characters were obsessed with money I didnt understand why so many liberties were taken with the actual facts turning the wrong way to hit the iceberg annoyed me The production standard was very good for the time and you can tell they spent a lot of money on the production,0.3087,Positive,1/14/2018,1

titanic,When doing research for Rainer Werner Fassbinder s Veronika Voss I stumbled upon the life story of doomed UFA actress Sybille Schmitz and the seemingly bizarre fact that Joseph Goebbels commissioned a propaganda film revolving around the sinking of the Titanic Nazi Germany s Titanic marks the sixth film made about the disaster and I believe it s the only one to go the extra mile and feature a heroic German first officer Hans Nielsen as well as an equally heroic ex Russian countess more,-0.5106,Negative,9/14/2024,1
titanic,They did Nazi that iceberg coming,0,Neutral,3/14/2024,1
titanic,The Nazis notorious re telling of the Titanic story attributes the ship s sinking to the recklessness of British and American stock speculators who repeatedly ignore the warnings of a wise brave and fictional German officer as the last act of Borzage s History Is Made at Night is twisted into propaganda,-0.2732,Negative,10/15/2024,1
titanic,wow if i had a nickel for every time a titanic movie had a plot point about a guy being arrested for stealing jewelry so someone else has to saves him with a fire ax while the hallways start flooding i d have two nickels which isn t a lot but it s weird that it happened twice right? also this movie is nazi propaganda i wish i was kidding,-0.2732,Negative,6/24/2023,1

titanic,Anti English minded Nazi pomp which James Cameron found very obviously inspiring A pleasantly entertaining catastrophe film the propaganda of which now looks clumsy and cute and its key scene the only German swims with a child in their arms of course faster than all the rescue boats can only paddle,0.7871,Positive,9/19/2024,1
titanic,I didn t know this movie and discovered it by chance I did NOT know the lumbar backstage situations and was shocked to find out everything that happened after the session Typical of Nazism unfortunately However during the session I was surprised what motivated the Machiavellian minister to be interested in this plot until the final sign who will make even more intrigued who swears that national socialism was a leftist regime Actually there is a lot like what I saw in the great version More,0.8993,Positive,9/15/2024,1
titanic,I can talk about the inaccuracies all day but what I really what to know is these two things First Do you think a movie about a sinking ship given the current course of the war is a really good idea? Second what s with the Russian being depicted as heroic along with the other Germans? It s 1943 The USSR hasn t been friendly with Nazis since 1941 so I m confused why a Russian is being depicted in such a positive way,0.8863,Positive,10/1/2012,1
titanic,Being another movie about the Titanic I was curious to check out this 1943 version a production made during the Second World War The production was commissioned by the Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels and his main aim in all of this obviously was to intensify Germany s power at all costs even in cinematographic terms trying to belittle and blame the British and Americans for the disaster through the means of propaganda a fact that becomes clear in this film more,-0.9081,Negative,1/14/2021,1
titanic,The German version of the Titanic story Propagandized for our viewing during the war Fascinating to watch,-0.1027,Negative,12/7/2024,1
titanic,Don t judge a book by its cover While the movie is infamously known as Nazi Titanic and yes the propaganda is clearly evident and somehow ineffective at doing so it s in reality a fairly competent movie with great acting on display I like to view the inserted fictional German officer as more of a warning of all the signs that something foreboding was coming but because of the pride of everyone onboard they end up falling on deaths ears With more,0.74,Positive,9/15/2022,1
titanic,This is Nazi propaganda,-0.25,Negative,4/8/2020,1
titanic,Undoubtedly a gigantic production that was definitely a large source of inspiration for James Cameron at the time because a lot from his Titanic can already be found here such as the romantic component or the trick technique a 6 meter long model was used here and in fact Herbert Selpin is created but at the same time this is above all a film owner of the Nazis Designed as an anti British propaganda film that is written down by historical facts among other things here is as more,-0.0387,Neutral,3/29/2022,1

titanic,The making of the film is far more interesting then the actual film I m pretty sure Cameron took a couple ideas from this movie too,0.8173,Positive,5/3/2023,1
titanic,Overall I thought it was fairly blase for a film dramatising the sinking of the Titanic made in Nazi Germany There s a decent amount of production value on display except for the miniature shots which look TERRIBLE though that s probably due to Goebbels being incredibly liberal with his budgeting on the film,-0.347,Negative,5/15/2024,1

titanic,put this on randomly as it was on tubi did NOT realize it was a joseph goebbels production till i realized what language the text is in and having read the history of the production and its lack of release i really am mesmerized i dont know what to make of it obviously fascistic in its na√Øvet√© aesthetics depiction of tragedy and its heroism but its so jarring almost a parody of hack filmmaking odd odd maybe part of the success of neoliberalism was that its propaganda films need only gesture to a motion to affirm it rather than dedicate its existence to proving itself,-0.5106,Negative,5/11/2024,1
titanic,Nazi Titanic! The final film from my childhood One I ve always wanted to see As a little boy I had NO idea this was a revisionist history anti British anti American nazi propaganda movie I know that now however But here s the thing I still wanted to see it as a piece of history with a fascinating backstory Look into the director if you like a good conspiracy and as I d also heard that titanic 43 is actually really good if you more,0.8297,Positive,2/7/2025,1

titanic,Can we all agree that besides being evil it s also just a really weird idea? Joseph Goebbels wanted to strike a propaganda coup against the United Kingdom and of all the things he could have done to critique Britain he commissioned a film about the sinking of the RMS Titanic animated by a batshit insane conspiracy theory involving a sophisticated plan by Bruce Ismay to manipulate the stock market and tank his own company so he could buy back the more,-0.7264,Negative,6/3/2018,1

titanic,Yes the film is full of anti British propaganda And that a single accidentally German officer predicts everything and of course totally heroic and selfless I found at least very amusing to ridiculous Overall I actually liked it for a propaganda machine The special effects in particular are well done for that time,0.7665,Positive,9/23/2021,1
titanic,How you can tell this is a Nazi production,0,Neutral,5/16/2024,1
titanic,Nazi propaganda effort that equates the ill fated Titanic to capitalism and greed while played out against a background of personal intrigues and romances James Cameron must have given this film more than a few rewatches before setting sail with his own version of the Titanic story Putting aside the propaganda elements the film is beautiful to look at with crisp deep focus cinematography bringing the ship to radiant life The special effects are fantastic for the time period and the film is meticulously acted by a committed cast,0.91,Positive,3/23/2020,1

titanic,Made by the nazis in 1943 It is clearly a propaganda film in which the British are the antoganist This film shows that due to the greed of the wealthy British who want to set a world record with the Titanic the ship has sunk The British wanted to make the Titanic the fastest ship in the world to give the shares of The White Star Line a higher value And because of that speed a collision with the iceberg more,0.4404,Positive,3/7/2019,1
titanic,Cannot believe the Nazis made a Titanic movie as propoganda to paint the British as incompetent killed the director halfway through production because he talked shit about the German army and then decided against releasing it in Germany when it was finally finished because the sinking ship metaphor was too representative of Nazi Germany at that point in WWII,-0.9042,Negative,7/15/2024,1
titanic,The reason the Goebbels commissioned Nazi version of Titanic has two directors is the original Herbert Selpin died midway through the production It was labeled a suicide In actuality he was murdered by the Gestapo after being overheard insulting the German army my Kino Lorber release speculates that his outburst was out of frustration over a slow second unit shooting session So this one is NOT a movie to like Luckily it s NOTHING worth commenting on much there is NO more,-0.9634,Negative,8/6/2024,1

titanic,The film has a significant historical value as it was one of the first attempts to portray the disaster epicly but it falls short of other more exciting and technically advanced versions It is especially interesting for those who study the history of cinema war propaganda or the impact of Titanic on popular culture,0.767,Positive,5/30/2024,1
titanic,During the shooting of the film director Herbert Selpin was reported by Gestapo about the German army Drunk soldiers have made actions that would disturb the women on the set He was immediately arrested and hanged in his cell the next day When the incident gathered Goebbels threatened those who excluded the screenwriter to share the same fate as the director Although the film was completed with another director Goebbels forbade the screening of the film in Germany,-0.886,Negative,7/14/2023,1

titanic,This is an interesting retelling of the story of the Titanic made in Nazi Germany in the midst of World War II The movie places the blame for the tragedy on English stock trading and greed and it casts a sympathetic eye on the ship s crew especially the hero who just happens to be a German The first part of the movie is a bit of a melodramatic slog with characters scheming about how to enrich themselves Once tragedy strikes more,-0.8865,Negative,2/26/2023,1

titanic,This film about the famous maritime disaster certainly had an interesting history Produced during the Third Reich the director ran afoul of the authorities before it was released and died in prison Later it would be screened in the GDR It opens with a meeting of angry shareholders who are perturbed that the ocean liner is becoming a financial drag We re the Board NOT some charity A sophisticated and impressive production it also has some excellent dialogue The cruise itself includes plenty of flirting and nonstop cynical financial scheming It clearly influenced the 1997 release of the same name Recommended,-0.8425,Negative,3/7/2023,1

the avengers ,There s brief flashes of fun and charm here and there but as a whole The Avengers is a lame attempt at bringing the 1960 s spy fi TV series to the big screen with the best efforts of a committed cast let down by poor writing and editing that manage to make what should be an enjoyably absurd plot remarkably dull instead,0.5123,Positive,5/15/2021,5

the avengers ,Is The Avengers considered a cult film yet? It has all the hallmarks of becoming one I think And it s NOT nearly as TERRIBLE as its reputation suggests I mean it s still NOT good but it s NOT the worst film to come out of the 1990s NOT by a long shot For years I avoided watching The Avengers in its entirety due to the scathingly bad reviews of the time Yet is it really that bad?,-0.8471,Negative,4/21/2021,5
the avengers ,Fun fact for folk the reason Avengers in 2012 was released here in the UK as Avengers Assemble an iconic line which famously wouldn t be uttered in the MCU for a further seven years NO less is because of this film I believe or maybe even The Avengers IP altogether and I am of course talking about the 60s espionage darling of British television on which this 90s big screen outing is based a rare example of such a show more,0.633,Positive,8/14/2018,5
the avengers ,Too odd and bizarre to be bad this was over the top silliness NOT sure if it s supposed to be like this but I enjoyed the fact that the people who made this film just go strange and don t stop Aspy espionage film tgat feels like it s on drugs It actually looks pretty good and has that 90s big budget blockbuster look Its NOT a great film but the time passed and I actually got into it,0.8867,Positive,8/23/2024,5

the avengers ,Upon release a baffling and catastrophic misfire a glossy big budget adaptation of the cult 1960s British TV series that missed the charm wit and style that made the original so beloved replacing them with borderline insane creative decisions and a script that seemed to favour overtly stylistic posturing rather than anything resembling a story And now?

the avengers ,I may be crazy but the homogenized style of blockbusters nowadays is starting to make these late 90s retro pulp throwbacks where absolute weightless CGI is thrown over real yet cartoony surfaces look visually appealing As far late 90s retro pulp throwbacks go I d definitely take this over Wild Wild West if solely because the verbal sparring and gender politics of Fiennes and Thurman s relationship is much more palatable then Will Smith and Kevin Kline mean spiritedly rejecting the gay camp they desperately should have embraced,-0.1804,Negative,3/16/2023,5

inside out 2 ,Inside Out 2 is a heartwarming and imaginative sequel that successfully builds on the emotional depth of its predecessor Directed by Kelsey Mann the film revisits Riley as she navigates the complexities of teenage life with her emotions Joy Sadness Anger Fear and Disgust returning to guide her The movie introduces new emotions adding fresh dynamics and challenges The animation is vibrant and expressive capturing the nuanced portrayal of inner emotional worlds With its clever storytelling humor and poignant moments Inside Out 2 resonates deeply with audiences offering a thoughtful exploration of growing up and emotional resilience,0.9393,Positive,4/27/2025,7
inside out 2 ,The wizards at Pixar have crafted a new gem with Inside Out 2 which is a rare achievement in that it is a sequel that outdoes the original film The movie opens with Riley Kensington Tallman just after her 13th Birthday as Joy Amy Poehler recaps her accomplishments and sets the stage for her big Hockey Game with her friends Grace Grace Lu and Bree Sumayyah Nuriddin Green Their success on the ice attracts the attention of the coach of the local Firebirds who invites the trio to a three day camp which will set the stage for them to be included on the team as freshmen Things take a turn when a Puberty alarm goes off followed by a construction crew to upgrade the console Fear Tony Hale Anger Lewis Black Disgust Liza Lapira and Sadness Phyllis Smith do NOT react well to this and the arrival of the new emotions Anxiety Maya Hawke Envy Ayo Edebiri Ennui Ad√®le Exarchopoulos and Embarrassment Paul Walter Hauser sets the stage for new conflicts Riley arrives at camp and becomes enchanted with the popular girls who are fronted by Valentina Lilimar and Riley excludes her friends as a chance to be part of the in crowd The new emotions set a course to keep Riley safe from her potential future issues and banish the old emotions that they view as hindering Riley and setting a path for future failure Forced to travel to the furthest reaches of Riley s mind to recover something of necessity the old emotions hope to undo the damage being done and restore Riley who is in the turmoil of being a teen and hampered by the flood of new and often conflicting emotions and circumstances that she encounters The movie is filled with charm and humor as well as presenting an honest look at the changes and pressures that children face during their teen years and does so WITHOUT being heavy handed The emotions new and old are great and there are many moments throughout the film that will bring laughter as well as nostalgia for adults especially those with children who are about to enter their Teen years The film is moving and there were more than a few eyes welling up near the end of the film during our screening as Pixar has once again crafted an enjoyable and relatable tale that can be enjoyed by the entire family 4 5 stars out of 5,0.921,Positive,4/27/2025,7
inside out 2 ,I really quite enjoyed the first of these 2015 but I struggled a bit to stay engaged with the one Riley is still happily coasting through family life until one day she embarks on the yellow brick road that is puberty Towit her control gallery is NO longer the purview of just her lifelong guides like Fear Joy and Anger now she has also to deal with the likes of disgust envy boredom and worst of all anxiety It s maybe the latter that the film should be called as we now embark on quite a humourless swipe at the culture of validation that young people must navigate It s all about being popular Being liked Being the best in the ice hockey team Old loyalties go under the bus in favour of new aspirations and yes much of it does ring quite true as an evaluation of the fickleness in all of us Thing is though there s just too much inevitability about what comes next and there s way too much incessant dialogue Anger has some fun along the way and there is the odd comedy one liner from the laconic Ennui but it just didn t resonate with me at all The animation is standard Pixar fayre that does the job colourfully but unremarkably and by the conclusion I was hoping there was an off button on that great big console Yep I m probably too old to really appreciate this the way the kids can but the trick for these studios has to be to engage the adults at the same time as the weans else out come the mobile phones as our own version of ennui sets in It s fine but forgettable sorry,0.9866,Positive,4/27/2025,7
inside out 2 ,_Inside Out 2_ is a harmless sequel that is fun for all ages but also absolutely unnecessary The film recycles three quarters of the original while introducing a quarter of new characters and ideas Full review,0.6808,Positive,4/27/2025,7
inside out 2 ,Poor Pixar! They just haven t been able to catch a break this decade! Having a majority of their originals dumbed on Disney Lightyear flopping and Elemental just barely managing to make a comeback after having the studio s worst opening yet They just can t catch a break specially with Disney laying off their animators and refusing to let them make any originals anymore Safe to say they ve had it rough! But Inside Out 2 despite many things working against it actually managed to be good in fact great! Almost as good as its predecessor I m NOT gonna fully say it s a masterpiece like any of their older films or even films like Soul or the first Inside Out but it s still a pretty great movie! A movie that honors the original while adding to the original s themes Instead of just being the first movie again they actually do things a little different by adding new emotions covering the themes of puberty and anxiety and adding some new locations I also like how they don t just reset Joy back to the way she was in movie 1 they actually stick to her character development letting the others help her especially Sadness and being open to new ideas She s still flawed of course but it s more still growing as a character rather than just learning the same lesson again They even subvert the originals message Inside Out 1 it s okay to NOT be happy Inside Out 2 It s okay to let happiness in You are valued and you are good enough There s also one scene in the movie the panic attack I won t spoil what happens but I really LOVE how this scene played out Altogether a pretty solid film that builds on the original ti the point where I d actually say I d be open for a 3rd movie something I thought I d NEVER ever say ever!!!

inside out 2 ,When I first heard about the sequel to Inside Out I approached it with a mix of excitement and apprehension The original film is a masterpiece one of Pixar s finest achievements seamlessly blending humor emotion and a profound understanding of human psychology Given Pixar s recent uneven track record I feared that the sequel might NOT live up to the high standards set by its predecessor However I am delighted to report that isn t the case here I can confidently say that Inside Out 2 is a worthy successor to the original It almost reaches the same level of excellence taking the story in a fresh direction with a new cast of characters that enrich the narrative The sequel introduces a beautifully nuanced character Anxiety portrayed by Maya Hawke Hawke s performance brings a sympathetic depth to the role making Anxiety a character that audiences can relate to and care for The character adds a layer of complexity to the story that resonates on multiple levels Anxiety s interactions with Joy played masterfully once again by Amy Poehler highlight the inevitable struggles of growing up Poehler s Joy continues to be the heart of the film The story s emotional core remains as powerful as ever As a father the original film spoke to me deeply about understanding and acknowledging my children s emotions all by extension This sequel shifts the focus inward reflecting the internal emotional landscape of adolescence and early adulthood Riley our protagonist is growing up and the introduction of more complex emotions reflects the reality of her development The film brilliantly captures the awkwardness and discomfort of this transition making it relatable for both younger audiences and adults Some interactions in the film are cringe worthy because they are so true to life We ve all experienced moments of anxiety and self doubt and seeing them portrayed so authentically on screen is both uncomfortable and cathartic Amy Poehler s portrayal of Joy remains a highlight and Maya Hawke s Anxiety is a beautifully crafted antagonist who evolves throughout the film By the end Anxiety isn t just a source of conflict but a character that facilitates growth and understanding This development adds depth to the narrative making it more than just a children s film but a profound exploration of emotional growth Inside Out 2 is a summer movie that stands as a high point for family entertainment It balances humor and emotion with a storyline that speaks to both children and adults Pixar has once again delivered a film that NOT only entertains but also enlightens reminding us of the importance of understanding and embracing all our emotions For anyone who loved the first film this sequel is a must watch capturing the same magic while exploring new emotional territory If you cherished the original for its insightful portrayal of emotions you will find Inside Out 2 a worthy and enriching continuation of Riley s journey It s a film that promises to be both a hit with families and a valuable conversation starter about the complex world of emotions,0.9972,Positive,4/27/2025,7
inside out 2 ,Inside Out 2 brilliantly follows up its predecessor with a heartwarming and deeply insightful exploration of the human mind Directed by Pete Docter and produced by Pixar Animation Studios this sequel delves even deeper into the complexities of emotions creating a movie that is as intellectually stimulating as it is emotionally resonant The film continues the story of Riley now a teenager navigating the tumultuous waters of adolescence The return of our beloved emotions Joy Sadness Anger Fear and Disgust offers a delightful reunion while introducing new emotional characters that reflect the evolving complexity of Riley s inner world Each emotion is beautifully voiced bringing authenticity and depth to their characters Amy Poehler s Joy and Phyllis Smith s Sadness once again shine their dynamic evolving in ways that are both surprising and deeply moving,0.9715,Positive,4/27/2025,7
inside out 2 ,Inside Out 2 is a suggestion to follow Riley s troubles during adolescence which adds new characters to this animated movie Anxiety and Envy besides Joy Sadness Anger Fear and Disgust Both animation and voice acting are great and the animation properly shows the confusion and disorder of a teenage girl s mind Compared to Toy Story 2 it may NOT be as rich in genuine sentiment but it returns all viewers children and adults to the challenge of the act of growing up I also enjoyed the comedy and the themes present in it and maybe because of the continuous showings or better comprehension of it allowed me to have less of a feeling compare to the first one although at some parts it is sort of teary It was interesting to see how Joy and Anxiety interacted with each other these characters are more real in terms of showing us how emotions work during decision making when you re in trouble If you enjoyed my experience check out the Latest Movie Reviews,0.941,Positive,4/27/2025,7

inside out 2 ,Just watched it today and in the beginning both anxiety and joy were giving obnoxious vibes At least they both realized it in the end Anxiety was more controlling than joy was in the first one very obsessive over the firehawks thing Very annoying,0.1063,Positive,4/27/2025,7
inside out 2 ,It rehashed a lot of the plot from the previous movie and kinda forgot about some of the concepts it set up in the first one I enjoyed it but it could have done with more drafting as it felt like only Anxiety was a properly developed character,0.5187,Positive,4/27/2025,7
inside out 2 ,I liked it it s NO better than the first and I feel like some of the new characters weren t used as much as they should have and the lower stakes hurt it a bit But it has enough redeemable qualities to know that this movie had more heart than previous Pixar sequels I think anxiety is a good antagonist and there is still enough drama and humor to keep you invested It s definitely better than any of the crap Disney has delivered recently,0.6634,Positive,4/27/2025,7
inside out 2 ,Yeah you don t even see much of the advanced emotions play out in other people either They re just shoved behind a curtain I kinda wanted to see more of boredom and envy but anxiety was just hogging screen time like a toddler on a sugar high,0.3941,Positive,4/27/2025,7

inside out 2 ,t s a good movie and a solid sequel to the first one And I HATED the trailers The introduction of new emotions missed the point of the first movie We saw Depression in the original movie It was the console locking up Anxiety shouldn t be a new emotion it should be a malfunction or Fear turning to the Dark Side so to speak But having heard it s good I gave it a shot and I did enjoy it and would be happy to rewatch it,0.8668,Positive,4/27/2025,7

spider-man no way home ,I m torn on this one I appreciated the smaller moments the interactions and relationships between the main cast and the relationship between MCU Peter Parker and his Sony counterparts At the same time the whole thing feels so cynical and contrived less an actual story than an attempt to build corporate synergy using your pleasant memories of past experiences The whole experience of watching the movie is NOT unlike eating Taco Bell Pleasurable in the moment even something you occasionally look forward to but an hour later you realize you need to have an actual meal,0.4247,Positive,8/10/2024,12
spider-man no way home ,For how busy and packed with characters NO Way Home is it is still impressive how little any of it resonates beyond a pale mirror of other Spider Man images It is true that stories about the cyclical lives of super heroes are a comic book staple and I ve certainly read much more mediocre versions of same but it still don t justify how much of a whimper Garfield saving Zendaya comes off when the movie self conscious treat it as more,0.873,Positive,12/13/2021,12

top gun maverick,I think Top Gun Maverick isn t any different from films like Triumph of the Will or The Birth of a Nation in terms of how dangerous of an art it is Lots of folks have already pointed out that the film s basically propaganda for the U S military but simply calling it propaganda can be intellectually lazy and everything can be considered as propaganda if we were to facilitate a conversation about this Nowadays propaganda carries negative connotations but it s important more,-0.8898,Negative,5/20/2023,14

frozen 2,Rewatched for thanksgiving this film still absolutely rocks Disney really took a chance branching out from their traditional narrative for something more passive introspective surprisingly much more akin to a story you d expect from Ghibli In addition to having some of the most impressive visual sequences in animation a soundtrack that far surpasses that of the first film this film is also a near perfect example of Maureen Murdock s Heroine s Journey arc The shift toward a more feminine narrative in more,0.9503,Positive,2/25/2020,16
frozen 2,Set three years after the neatly wrapped fairy tale ending of the first film this 58th full length animation from Disney sees Kristen Anderson Lopez and Robert Lopez coming back to compose new songs following many from the first becoming so iconic and it s probably here that this movie fails the most as NOTHING reaches the stature of the previous songs,-0.2051,Negative,12/8/2019,16

frozen 2,I think the most difficult challenge for a movie like Frozen II is justifying its existence The first film told a perfectly self contained story with a dramatically resonant if imperfect conclusion The very nature of a musical too makes the songs integral to the film s success and extremely difficult to replicate Frozen II is mostly successful at the tall task,0.8356,Positive,3/17/2024,16

Toy Story 4,True mixed feelings on this one Whilst I obviously enjoyed this how can you NOT with this set of characters it s a film I don t think needed to be made Personally I don t think this quite lives up to the original trilogy quality wise although the signature adventure and character dynamics are all there and this remains such an entertaining watch The film does still manage to provide a worthy conclusion but after Lightyear and with a fifth film being in production I can t help but feel like Disney are exploiting the Toy Story franchise,0.9153,Positive,7/29/2021,21

Toy Story 4,It s a good movie though the justification for its existence and its connection to the larger Toy Story universe is tenuous at best It struggles a bit with the Woody Bo Peep romance as well as with characters like Buzz when it comes to building off of what we ve seen in the series predecessors On the new character side of things it introduces interesting themes with Forky while simultaneously dropping them in favor of strange digressions and half formed ideas It s oftentimes more,0.9468,Positive,6/23/2019,21

Toy Story 4,To talk about Toy Story 4 is to talk about Forky This is a movie that doesn t initially appear to have any compelling reason to exist the forced but satisfying third installment of Pixar s signature franchise seemed to wrap things up when it came out almost a full decade ago and yet Forky alone is enough to elevate this potential cash grab into the beautiful and hilarious coda that its long running series needed to be truly complete Forky is more,0.9403,Positive,9/29/2019,21

Toy Story 4,This suffers from some of later day Pixar blandness and formula bound tendencies some of the chases get tiring in a way they don t on the previous films but it is carried by the Toy Story movies believe in playing up neurosis into as large a pop spectacle as it can It is a very sick film about a guy coping badly with rejection by psychotic dedicating himself to some domesticity ideal,-0.8761,Negative,1/3/2025,21

Toy Story 4,The thing I like about the TOY STORYs is that because the toys existential angst is so foregrounded and palpable the movies can go from almost cloying to downright upsetting on a dime This one even gets near the idea that Woody and the gang s relative stability is a privileged experience that the life of your average toy is probably a sad lonely one that their self actualization is rare The adventure this time is slight but the egalitarian streak is more,-0.128,Negative,6/6/2022,21

beauty and the beast,Only fitting that a man who always looked for beauty traumatized by losing a father at the tender age of 10 and in what fashion! saw poetry everywhere and was able to create the most tender adaptation of classic tale I m NOT sure if any other artist of the time would have had this practiced eternal eye of a poet as Cocteau for this project we know many great filmmakers from that time but I doubt they could have more,-0.2899,Negative,3/20/2017,40

incredibles 2,Bird is one of the most visually sophisticated animators we have his rich detailed lighting and rigorous camera movements NEVER fail to amaze but this is about exactly zero things Or more accurately it s filled with so many moments and gestures that imply Things that are then mashed together so vaguely and incomprehensibly into plot that they are rendered completely meaningless Fun tho lots of creative action beats and funny passages involving family dynamics I could ve watched that raccoon bit for at least another hour,0.9339,Positive,5/24/2022,41

incredibles 2,The politics are so muddled and meaningless that I almost think Bird deliberately wrote them that way to dispel the lingering oversimplifications of the first film s supposed Randianism Its empty arguments about mass media manipulation chauvinist breadwinner insecurity and completely unresolved notions of the role the special should play in shaping and running society The action though is so spectacular and focused and the animation retains the character of the first with much better definition and meticulousness that I still loved this The scene with Jack Jack and the raccoon is currently one of the best comedy and action scenes of the year,0.8689,Positive,6/15/2018,41

the fate of the furious,surprisingly one of my favorites in the franchise and unsurprisingly it has a lot to do with charlize theron and how much weight she easily brings to her character instantly solidifying her as the best villain in the series so far tonally this goes to some dark and overdramatic places but it s also the funniest with a shakespearean plot that kept me more invested than ever before also i still LOVE it when the cars go fast NO more big thoughts only fast,0.9246,Positive,4/12/2017,42

minions,Surprisingly NOT as bad as it could ve been There s some interesting ideas enjoyable characters and a handful of jokes that caught my off guard but my problem with this movie is that it feels almost inherently soulless It s practically the definition of a lazy cash grab right up there with the Disney live action remakes It serves to bleed every bit of money it can out of these characters and doesn t even offer a mildly entertaining movie beneath its lack of passion more,0.6027,Positive,1/5/2016,44

minions,so the movie explicitly tells you that throughout history the minions followed the most evil leader they could find okay the movie itself takes place roughly in the 60s okay presumably a few years are lost prior to the 60s because the minions are shown to have established their own settlement temporarily WITHOUT an evil person after they accidentally kill napoleon okay when the minions kill napoleon it is clearly during a wartime period so likely this is somewhere in more,-0.9589,Negative,7/6/2022,44

minions,If you look through comments with this high a rating most will be ironic but this isn t Minions doesn t deserve the HATE because it s actually amazing as some might say This technically makes the comic relief characters into the main role but that always seemed to be a complaint from people who haven t watched the movie The opening act is exceptional in pacing and content It knows the right amount of villains they served to show NOT too much or more,-0.7953,Negative,2/19/2021,44

captain america civil war,Captain America conceived and drawn by Jack Kirby was and always will be one of my favorite superheroes A nearly pure kineticism arrayed against grotesque madness My favorite Cap Kirby era was its most unhinged the post Nixon Seventies where whatever moral center there was it was NOT aligned with governmental authority and certainly NOT with the legacy of the United States Cap s journey was inward into an interiority left mostly vacant through constant violence into the fringes of American Life conspiracies more,0.5423,Positive,5/6/2016,45

captain america civil war,My increasing appreciation for the small interpersonal moments in these is at odds with their seemingly endless bloat So many movies so much setup and it still takes 90 minutes to get to the good stuff But if they were tighter perhaps you d lose all the best beats like a robot man cooking dinner for a girl he likes Anyway the big everybody vs everybody showdown is as thrillingly dorky a sequence as you could want Ant Man MVP,0.9442,Positive,3/9/2025,45
captain america civil war,Yeah it s a bit of a big jumbled mess of a million things happening in that way that Marvel sometimes gets right and sometimes gets wrong but for me it s mostly right The plan is convoluted as hell but the action choreography is top notch of course the airport scene is great as well as Black Panther chasing Cap Bucky but this one also gives us that nice soft intro to Black Panther Spider Man which honestly helps both their first movies since we ve already broke the ice with them Great characters great action and a fun final act make this a real solid MCU experience,0.9832,Positive,2/19/2023,45

aquaman,It is a mixture of teen series from the 2000s with H2O Mermaid Girls Blue Lagoon Baywatch Freeform s Siren series and porn movie that takes place on the beach However I liked the result Obviously it wouldn t be a literal adaptation of Aquaman s comics but I think it would be a good series just like Smallville was a good teen adaptation for Superman I think the series had the potential to be cool despite the low budget it would have to be a television series I was interested in knowing how this story would be continued pity it was canceled in the pilot episode,0.9597,Positive,11/26/2023,46

aquaman,I came to this after watching Smallville where Alan Richter played Aquaman and Justin Hartley played the Green Arrow This just feels like such a bad miscasting for him as Aquaman Justin Hartley has this mystery to him and this sense of charm rich kid syndrome that Arthur Curry does NOT have It feels like a battle of trying to conceal his own personality instead of leaning into that like they did with Hartley as Oliver Queen which worked out very well,0.9168,Positive,12/29/2024,46

aquaman,Be sure to watch after the film by James Van it will be interesting to identify similarities and absence They suddenly have a shock for ether s broadcasting but I perfectly understand why the project was turned off the main character is such a sucker and all the secondary ones are similar to him even Wing Reimz does NOT look at the place and obviously expensive for the then television industry Well Smallville still played and there was NOTHING to twist like garbage It was a boring hour in short,0.4651,Positive,11/17/2024,46

Failed pilots are curious peaks into alternate timelines,0.4304,Positive,3/20/2025,46
aquaman,Aquaman is an intriguing blend of potential and eye catching cast Despite its promising premise and solid performances particularly from Hartley and Lou Diamond Phillips the movie feels more suited to a late night 90s TV show than a standalone film,0.1882,Positive,11/29/2024,46
